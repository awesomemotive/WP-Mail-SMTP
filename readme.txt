== Description ==

= WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin =

Having problems with your WordPress site not sending emails? You're not alone. Over 900,000 websites use WP Mail SMTP to fix their email deliverability issues.

WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring the wp_mail() PHP function to use a proper SMTP provider.

= What is SMTP? =

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. SMTP helps increase email deliverability by using proper authentication.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc are constantly improving their services to reduce email spam. One of the things their spam tools look for is whether an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.

If the proper authentication isn't there, then the emails either go in your SPAM folder or worst not get delivered at all.

This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="friend">WPForms</a>.

The issue is that most <a href"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" rel="friend">WordPress hosting companies</a> don't have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.

= How does WP Mail SMTP work? =

WP Mail SMTP plugin allows you to easily reconfigure the wp_mail() function to use a trusted SMTP provider.

This helps you fix all WordPress not sending email issues.

WP Mail SMTP plugin includes four different SMTP setup options:

1. Mailgun SMTP
2. SendGrid SMTP
3. Gmail SMTP
4. All Other SMTP

For all options, you can specify the "from name" and "email address" for outgoing emails.

Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one. This is what makes WP Mail SMTP, the best SMTP solution for WordPress.

= Mailgun SMTP =

Mailgun SMTP is a popular SMTP service provider that allows you to send large quantities of emails. They allow you to send your first 10,000 emails for free every month.

WP Mail SMTP plugin offers a native integration with MailGun. All you have to do is connect your Mailgun account, and you will improve your email deliverability.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/how-to-send-wordpress-emails-with-mailgun/" rel="friend">Mailgun documentation</a> for more details.

= Gmail SMTP =

Often bloggers and small business owners don't want to use third-party SMTP services. Well you can use your Gmail or G Suite account for SMTP emails.

This allows you to use your <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-setup-a-professional-email-address-with-gmail-and-google-apps/" rel="friend">professional email address</a> and improve email deliverability.

Unlike other Gmail SMTP plugins, our Gmail SMTP option uses OAuth to authenticate your Google account, keeping your login information 100% secure.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/how-to-securely-send-wordpress-emails-using-gmail-smtp/" rel="friend">Gmail documentation</a> for more details.

= SendGrid SMTP =

SendGrid has a free SMTP plan that you can use to send up to 100 emails per day. With our native SendGrid SMTP integration, you can easily and securely set up SendGrid SMTP on your WordPress site.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/fix-wordpress-email-notifications-with-sendgrid/" rel="friend">SendGrid documentation</a> for more details.

= Other SMTP =

WP Mail SMTP plugin also works with all major email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Microsoft Live, and any other email sending service that offers SMTP.

You can set the following options:

* Specify an SMTP host.
* Specify an SMTP port.
* Choose SSL / TLS encryption.
* Choose to use SMTP authentication or not.
* Specify an SMTP username and password.

WP Mail SMTP also gives you the option to insert your password in your wp-config.php file, so it's not visible in your WordPress settings.
