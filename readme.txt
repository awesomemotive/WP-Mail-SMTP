### WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin

Having problems with your WordPress site not sending emails? You're not alone. Over 3 million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send their emails reliably.

Our goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.

WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.

Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.

WP Mail SMTP is free and has everything you need to reliably send your WordPress emails!

<a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">**WP Mail SMTP Pro**</a> unlocks even more powerful features like email logging, advanced email reporting and stats, backup connections, email alerts, smart conditional routing, and much more.

#### What is SMTP?

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.

If the proper authentication isn't there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don't get delivered at all.

This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="friend">WPForms</a>.

The issue is that most <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" rel="friend">WordPress hosting companies</a> don't have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.

#### How does WP Mail SMTP work?

WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the `wp_mail()` function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.

When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider's direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.

This helps you fix all <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/" rel="friend">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.

WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:

1. SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong>
2. SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
3. Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
4. Mailgun SMTP
5. SendGrid SMTP
6. Postmark SMTP
7. SparkPost SMTP
8. Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)
9. Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
10. Amazon SES SMTP <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
11. Zoho Mail SMTP <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
12. All Other SMTP

For most options, you can specify the "from name" and "email address" for outgoing emails.

Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one. This is what makes WP Mail SMTP, the best SMTP solution for WordPress.

#### SendLayer

SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.

Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress. It also has open and click tracking, email logs, and email list management.

### Email Log

Email Logging lets you log and view all emails sent from your site. Email logs are helpful for storing emails for your records, auditing outgoing emails, and debugging during site development.

But that's just the beginning. Our powerful <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/log-emails-wordpress/" rel="friend">WordPress email logs</a> unlock extra tools to help you measure email engagement and improve email deliverability:

#### Email Log Details

Each Email Log entry includes a lot of useful information about the email, including the subject, sender, recipients (TO, CC and BCC), email content, email headers, open&click tracking stats, delivery status, which WordPress plugin sent the email, and more!

#### Resend Emails

You resend any email or forward it to one or more email addresses, right from your email log. From the overview page, you can also resend multiple emails in bulk. This is an awesome way to resend emails that failed or forward important emails to an alternative email address.

#### Store Email Attachments

WP Mail SMTP lets you store all of the email attachments that are sent from your WordPress site. That makes it easy to review an attachment or archive it locally.

#### Export Email Logs

Easily export your WordPress email logs to CSV, EML, or Excel. You can filter the email logs before you export and only download the data you need. This feature lets you easily create your own deliverability reports. You can also use the data in 3rd party dashboards to track deliverability along with your other website statistics.

#### Print Emails

Once you've activated email logging, any individual log file can be printed in an easy-to-read format. If you want to archive an email log digitally, it's easy to export it to a PDF document too.

### Email Reports

Email reports make it easy to track deliverability and engagement at-a-glance. Your open and click-through rates are grouped by subject line, making it easy to review the performance of campaigns or notifications. The report also displays Sent and Failed emails each week so you can spot any issues quickly. You'll also see an email report chart right in your WordPress dashboard.

#### Weekly Email Summary

Get statistics about WordPress emails sent directly into your inbox. Our weekly emails reveal how many emails are being sent from your WordPress site, and which ones are getting opens and clicks. The Summary also shows you deliverability statistics at-a-glance so you can spot any issues without logging into WordPress.

#### Track Email Opens and Clicks

Wondering if your important emails were actually opened, or if any links in the email were clicked? Our email log allows you <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/enable-wordpress-email-tracking/" rel="friend">view open and click tracking stats for your WordPress emails</a> and our Email Reports feature groups these stats by subject, so you can analyze their performance.

### Email Alerts

Get instantly notified about failed emails! If your site's mailer or SMTP service stops sending your emails, you'll immediately receive a notification. Choose from several helpful alert methods, including:

- Email Notifications
- Slack Notifications
- SMS/Twilio Notifications
- Webhook Notifications

In combination with Email Logging and Email Resend, Email Alerts let you ensure that no important email will ever be lost.

### Backup Connection

WP Mail SMTP Pro allows you to configure multiple mailer providers. The main configuration will be your Primary Connection, and you can set another as your Backup Connection.
If an email fails to send via your Primary Connection, WP Mail SMTP will automatically route it through your Backup Connection and try to send it again. This means fewer missed emails, even when something goes wrong.

### Smart Conditional Routing

Smart Routing enables you to send emails through different mailer providers based on custom criteria. Easily configure your Smart Routing conditions using dozens of pre-determined options, including the contents of the email Subject or Message, From or To addresses, or which plugin initiated the email, just to name a few.

Using Smart Routing lets you choose the best mailer for each type of email you send. Select a transactional mailer to send out your eCommerce order confirmations, another mailer for your newsletter and marketing emails, and more!

Selecting the best mailer for each type of email you need to send will improve your overall deliverability and make sure your emails arrive in users' inboxes.

### Manage WordPress Emails and Notifications

The Manage Notification feature gives you full control over which email notifications WordPress sends. This means you can disable different WordPress notification emails. Don't want to receive emails when new users are created? No problem, turn it off.

### WordPress Multisite

#### WordPress Multisite Network Settings

For users running a multisite network, our network settings provide a centralized location to easily configure your SMTP settings for all sites, saving you time.

#### Manage Multisite Email Logs Easily

WP Mail SMTP makes it easy for Network Admins to view and manage email logs for subsites. You can access all of your deliverability information from the Network Admin dashboard and quickly switch between subsites. That makes it easy to review email logging data for all subsites on one centralized page.

### Expert Support

We provide <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-mail-smtp-support-policy/">limited support</a> for the WP Mail SMTP plugin on the WordPress.org forums. Access to our world class one-on-one email support is available to <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">WP Mail SMTP Pro</a> users.

#### White Glove Setup

Our White Glove Setup service is a great option that anyone can benefit from. Whether you don't have the time or maybe you feel a bit in over your head - we've got you covered.

You can sit back and relax while we set up everything for you. White glove setup includes WP Mail SMTP plugin installation and setup, configuration adjustments to your DNS for proper email domain name verification, SMTP.com or Mailgun setup, and final testing to confirm everything is passing with flying colors.

### Security

The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.

- Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as SMTP.com, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark and SparkPost, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.

- When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your `wp-config.php` file, so it's not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.

### Languages

We know that majority of people do not speak English, so we professionally translated WP Mail SMTP and WP Mail SMTP Pro into the following languages:

- Spanish (Spain),
- German,
- Portuguese (Brazil),
- Italian,
- French,
- Japanese,
- Polish,
- Dutch,
- Russian,
- Turkish

If you have one of these languages configured in your WordPress admin area, then WP Mail SMTP's user interface will use that language as well.
