Our goal is to make email deliverability easy so that your emails always reach the inbox.

WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.

Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.

#### What is SMTP?

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry-standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by adding authentication to the emails sent from your site.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers, so they check whether emails are originating from a genuine sender. If the proper authentication isn't there, emails either go in the SPAM folder or, worse, disappear.

This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites. By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like [WPForms](https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo-wpmailsmtp&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme).

But most [WordPress hosting companies](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/) don't have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

This is why WordPress emails aren’t delivered.

#### How does WP Mail SMTP work?

WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by changing the way your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the `wp_mail()` function to use proper SMTP host credentials or an SMTP mail provider.

With our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider's direct API. Even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails will still be sent successfully.

This helps you fix all [WordPress not sending email](https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme) issues.

WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP mailers:

1. SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong>
2. SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
3. Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
4. Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)
5. Mailgun SMTP
6. Mailjet SMTP
7. SendGrid SMTP
8. Postmark SMTP
9. SparkPost SMTP
10. SMTP2GO
11. Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) [[Pro]](https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme)
12. Amazon SES SMTP [[Pro]](https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme)
13. Zoho Mail SMTP [[Pro]](https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin&utm_content=readme)
14. Other SMTP

Limited support is available for WP Mail SMTP users via WordPress.org support forums.

Email support and set up assistance is available to WP Mail SMTP Pro users.

= How can I migrate from a different SMTP plugin to WP Mail SMTP? =

Want to switch from your old SMTP plugin to WP Mail SMTP? We made it easy for you to migrate your SMTP settings in one click!

WP Mail SMTP will automatically detect your existing SMTP plugin (Easy WP SMTP, FluentSMTP, etc) when you run our easy Setup Wizard. Just click Import to copy your settings over.

Our one-click migration tool supports all of these plugins:

- Easy WP SMTP
- FluentSMTP
- Post SMTP Mailer
- SMTP Mailer
- WP SMTP

= Is WP Mail SMTP available in other languages? =

We know that majority of people do not speak English, so we professionally translated WP Mail SMTP and WP Mail SMTP Pro into the following languages:

- Spanish (Spain),
- German,
- Portuguese (Brazil),
- Italian,
- French,
- Japanese,
- Polish,
- Dutch,
- Russian,
- Turkish

= How can I increase plugin security? =

The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.

- Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as SendLayer, SMTP.com, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark, SparkPost and SMTP2GO, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.

- When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your `wp-config.php` file, so it's not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.

= I found a bug, now what? =

If you've stumbled upon a bug, the best place to report it is in the [WP Mail SMTP GitHub repository](https://github.com/awesomemotive/wp-mail-smtp). GitHub is where the plugin is actively developed, and posting there will get your issue quickly seen by our developers (myself and Slava). Once posted, we'll review your bug report and triage the bug. When creating an issue, the more details you can add to your report, the faster the bug can be solved.

= Can you add feature x, y or z to the plugin? =

Short answer: maybe.

By all means please contact us to discuss features or options you'd like to see added to the plugin. We can't guarantee to add all of them, but we will consider all sensible requests. We can be contacted here:
