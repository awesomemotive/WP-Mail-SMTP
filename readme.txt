###  WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin

Having problems with your WordPress site not sending emails? You're not alone. Over 1 million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send their emails reliably.

Our goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.

WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.

= What is SMTP? =

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, and Office 365 are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.

If the proper authentication isn't there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don't get delivered at all.

This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="friend">WPForms</a>.

The issue is that most <a href"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" rel="friend">WordPress hosting companies</a> don't have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.

= How does WP Mail SMTP work? =

WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the `wp_mail()` function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.

When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider's direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.

This helps you fix all WordPress not sending email issues.

WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:

1. SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
2. Pepipost SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong>
3. Sendinblue SMTP
4. Mailgun SMTP
5. SendGrid SMTP
6. Gmail SMTP
7. Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
8. Amazon SES SMTP <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
9. All Other SMTP

For all options, you can specify the "from name" and "email address" for outgoing emails.

Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one. This is what makes WP Mail SMTP, the best SMTP solution for WordPress.

= SMTP.COM =

### Security

The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.

- Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as SMTP.com, Pepipost and Mailgun, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.

- When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your `wp-config.php` file, so it's not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.
